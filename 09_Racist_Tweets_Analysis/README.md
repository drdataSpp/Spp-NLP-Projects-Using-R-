# NLP & Text Mining On Racist Tweets
This repository has R Scripts in which I have performed NLP and Text Mining on Racist Tweets.  

## How the analysis was performed?
- The orginal dataset was split into two subsets namely: Racist Tweets and Non-Racist Tweets.
- This subsets were used to perform NLP and Text Mining seperately to extract insights. 
- **The main purpose** of this project is to build two word clouds to understand what are the most used words that in Racist and Non-Racist Tweets.
