# NLP & Text Mining On Hotel Reviews
This repository has R Scripts in which I have performed NLP and Text Mining on Hotel Reviews.  

## How the analysis was performed?
- The orginal dataset was split into two subsets namely: Positive reviews and Negative Reviews.
- This subsets were used to perform NLP and Text Mining seperately to extract insights. 
- **The main purpose** of this project is to build two word clouds to understand what are the most used words that in positive and negative reviews. 

## How an executive is benefited here?
The Executive can note the most frequent terms/ words in the negative reviews word cloud and improve the Hotel and its food based on those factors, for example, he or she could work on improving the quality of the hotel's service or taste of the food to imporve customer satisfaction.
